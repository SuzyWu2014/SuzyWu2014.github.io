For the past year and a half, I've been working in two teams in IS at OSU as a student developer. My first year in ITIS team gave me an opportunity to work on a new opensourced [CoprHD project](coprhd.github.io) and collaborated with the community members and the developers from the industry actively. As the team leader, apart from the work assigned to me, I'm also responsible for tracking the progress of the team members, assuring the on-time delivery of a feature. Another portion of this project is to present the work to different audiences. Our team participated in two CoprHD developer summit and a Linux Storage Conference, giving presentation in two of them with the purposes varied from status update to product advocate.

My role in the second team is one of developers in the team with a more diverse work, which allows me to grasp many skills in short amount of time. Similar as the previous work, presentations are also common. Knowledges are shared within the team by demoing or explaining your work to the team. I think what valued most of the first team is the world it showed me, and the second team helps me to.

Another note from this period of work is to identify your thought process and learn things wisely.

Besides the skills and experiences I earned from my job, more importantly, it showcases the most important and necessary skills set desired from the industry.

## Presentation/Demo skills.
Being able to show your work within the team or to a larger audience is not just desiable but also necassary skills.

## Be able to learn and learn it quickly

## Asking questions wisely

## Identify the thought process

## Best practices for new tech

## take notes of your work for later.
