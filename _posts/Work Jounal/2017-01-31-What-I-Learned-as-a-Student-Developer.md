For the past year and a half, I've been working in two teams in IS at OSU as a student developer. My first year in ITIS team gave me an opportunity to work on the open source [CoprHD project](coprhd.github.io) and collaborate frequently with the community members and the developers from the industry. As the team leader, apart from the work assigned to me, I'm also responsible for tracking the progress of my team members, assuring the on-time delivery of the features. Giving presentations of our work based on different purposes to audiences from various backgrounds is another important part of this project.

My role in the second team is one of developers in the team. This team involves more diverse tasks allowing me to grasp many skills in a short period of time. Similar as the previous work, presentations are also common activities. Knowledges are shared within the team through demoing or explaining the work to the team members. On the other hand, I went through several interviews for the past year, which gave a sense of what will be asked in the interviews. Look back to my experiences of the interviews and my job, there are some tips I could share with the students who want to be developers, some of which I wish I could have done better as well.

## Enhance your communication Skills
I know this might sound cliche, but it is one of the most highly effective skills that can help you reach your goal whether it be getting the work done or getting the help you need. Specifically, being able to ask questions wisely will bring you the answer you need, avoid unnecessary mistakes or get out of the tar pits. In addition, email is another most common communication tool at work. A clear and concise email not only shows your professionality but also leading up to prompt replies.

## Presentation/Demo skills
As described above, presentations are commonplace at work, so being capable of showing your work through the presentations is not just desirable but also a necessarily. During the interviews, it's very likely to be asked to introduce the projects you have done to the interviewers, while at work it's even more frequent to demonstrate your work/idea to your team or even a larger audience. Therefore, if capable of delivering your ideas clearly or even vividly will be a big plus in the job market.

## technical Skills
Technical skills are your core competencies, and it's very important to keep strengthening the skills you already have. However, Being able to learn new skills and learn them quickly on demand might be even more valuable. Generally, it is very common that you are not familiar some of the techniques used in your project, which can be a programming language, a framework or a tool. Being able to grasp the knowledge and applying them to work is also a demonstration of your ability at work. Another suggestion is to be aware of your thought process and try to identify and form the most effective one for yourself. Thought process, such as how you learn things, how you debug and how you figure out a problem, will be changed over time along with your experience, and an awareness of it will help you improve your efficiency. This is also helpful for your interviews since a lot of interviewers try to identify your thought process from the way you answer their questions. Additionally, Putting down the notes for the work you have done is one of the things that I wish I could have done better. No matter how confident you thought you would remember the work, after leaving it aside for couple months or even weeks, everything will look completely new to you.

In a nut shell, technical skills along with the communication skills are the way to become a professional developer. I believe if one could continue enhancing the skills listed above and be able to show them to the employers, he/she will be a strong hire in the job market.
